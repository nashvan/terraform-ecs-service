# 1. to login to docker ecr
docker login -u AWS -p $(aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1) 216952475463.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com

## 2. build your docker image
docker build -t nashwan .

## 3. After the build completes, tag your image so you can push the image to this repository:
docker tag nashwan:latest 216952475463.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/nashwan:latest

## 4. Run the following command to push this image to your newly created AWS repository:
docker push 216952475463.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/nashwan:latest
